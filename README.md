# Challenge-10-OOPSVGlogo

In this challenge, the goal is to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an SVG file.

Here is the acceptance criteria:

GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for text
THEN I can enter up to three characters
WHEN I am prompted for the text color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I am prompted for a shape
THEN I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square
WHEN I am prompted for the shape's color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I have entered input for all the prompts
THEN an SVG file is created named `logo.svg`
AND the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line
WHEN I open the `logo.svg` file in a browser
THEN I am shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria I entered

I installed both the jest and inquirer packages, as required.
In order to run the application, you will need to put "node index.js" in the command line.
the user will be presented with npm inquirer questions which they will
respond to.
Once completed, a file named "SVG logo" will be created.

I have not done a video presentation and will not be adding that at this time. I need to catch up on my other challenges. I will complete at a later date.
